## Historical perspective
Being released in August 1979 by Atari, Lunar Lander is one of the first arcade games ever created. However, it wasn't particular successful (only 4830 units were produced). Yet the vector-graphics generator, which the game is based on, became successful by the release of “Asteroids” in November 1979. The main objective of Lunar Lander is to safely land a “Lunar Lander” on the surface of the moon. In the original game the terrain of the game is quite jagged and only has a few flat areas to land. Additionally the player has to check his fuel, otherwise the Lander will crash. To control the lander the player has to use the lander's thrusters to slow or speed it up. However, that is only the original game version, until today several clones have appeared with more or less the same concept. Lunaer Lander 1.0's goal for example is to land the Lunar Lander on a fixed position. There are no limitations regards the fuel and there is no real moon gravity. Yet the only real difficulty are the Frame per Seconds (FPS). As higher as the player sets these as more difficult the game becomes.

## 2D games in general

Before we start with the explanation of the game files, we first need to understand how 2D based games work and what requirements they have.

Above you can see the coordinate system used for Lunar Lander. On the X-Axis we set whether the Lander moves “right” or “left”, on the Y-Axis whether it moves “Up” or “Down”. This system is commonly used in 2D games, e.g. Doodle Jump or Angry Birds (just to name some popular mobile 2D games).
